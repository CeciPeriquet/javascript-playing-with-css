Third challenge from [Wes Bos Vanilla Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/).

## 🔧 Tecnologies

Built with HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript.

## 📐 JavaScript methods and functions

- document.querySelectorAll()
- forEach()
- addEventListener()
- setProperty()
- this
- dataset

## 📚 What did I learn

- Difference between a NodeList and an Array.
- That you can use a forEach in a NodeList (no need to convert it into an Array anymore).
- New kind of EventListeners: _change, mousemove_
- Keep learning about _data attributes_
